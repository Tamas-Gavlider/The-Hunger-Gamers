and symbolic meanings:

* **Black:** Often associated with elegance, and modernity.
* **Red:** Conveys excitement, energy, and passion.
* **Yellow:** Represents happiness, optimism, and energy.

These colours together create a bold, and energetic vibe.

* All pages on the website have:
  * Fully responsive header with navigation links which allow the user to navigate through the site.

The text Hunger Gamers is in the center of the page above the navigation links.<br>The navigation links to the websites pages (Home,Menu,Events) and the text Hunger Gamers will be visible on both cellphones and dekstops.
